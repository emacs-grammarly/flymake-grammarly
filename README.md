## üîß Usage

To enable this package, simply add loading to your config like the code below.

```el
(require 'flymake-grammarly)
```

You can generally call `flymake-grammarly-load` to any `mode-hook` for
grammarly to start working.

```el
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flymake-grammarly-load)
(add-hook 'latex-mode-hook 'flymake-grammarly-load)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'flymake-grammarly-load)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'flymake-grammarly-load)
```

otherwise you can call `flymake-grammarly-maybe-load` like the snippt below.

```el
(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'flymake-grammarly-maybe-load)
```

If you encounter the performance issue, try raise `flymake-grammarly-check-time` higher.
The request will be send by this time everytime the buffer has changed.

```el
(setq flymake-grammarly-check-time 0.8)
```

## üìù Todo List

- [ ] Strip only text data, if other data like `# header` or `> quote` will return nothing.
- [ ] Usable but not fast enough, really depends on Grammarly's analyzer.
